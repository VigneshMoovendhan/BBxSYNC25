Hi Guys,

Due to verison conflicts, I have two seperate Requirements.txt for Langchain and Langgraph directories. So Accordingly create two different virtual environments for both the directories.

Then,
You have to create a .env file to store the API keys and place it in the main directory itself.

ENV file should consist of:

OPENAI_API_KEY=""

GOOGLE_API_KEY=""

TAVILY_API_KEY=""

SERPAPI_API_KEY=""

Place your API keys in the respective placeholders. 

In case you have any doubt, reach out to https://www.linkedin.com/in/vigneshoffcl/.

Happy Learning, Thank you!
